<!--section 8.2-->
The abductive meta-interpreter will loop on the program
```Prolog
wise(X):-not teacher(X).
teacher(peter):-wise(peter).
```
with the query `?-abduce(teacher(peter),E)` (see {numref}`sec:8.2`). Change the interpreter such that this query is handled correctly, by adding **all** literals collected in the proof to the abductive explanation.
