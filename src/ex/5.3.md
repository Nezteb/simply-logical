Consider the following program:
```Prolog
brother(peter,paul).
brother(adrian,paul).
brother(X,Y):-brother(Y,X).
brother(X,Y):-brother(X,Z),brother(Z,Y).
```
Compare and explain the behaviour of `prove_bf/1` and Prolog on the query `?-brother(peter,adrian)`. Can you re-order the clauses, such that Prolog succeeds?
