<!--section 4.1-->
Implement the predicate `term_write_bf/1`, which writes the tree represented by a term from the root downward (as opposed to the predicate `term_write/1` of {numref}`sec:4.1`, which writes from left to right). Employ breadth-first search with two agendas, one for nodes at depth $n$ and the other for nodes at depth $n + 1$.
